# Productivity Timer App

A simple productivity app built with Expo CLI and React Native that turns everyday tasks into a fun challenge. The app helps you stay focused—whether you’re studying, working out, or learning a new skill—by setting a timer for your session. When the timer ends, you’re rewarded with a celebratory pop-up (complete with confetti and a “dopamine reward”) to keep you motivated.

## Features

- **Flexible Timer Options:**  
  Choose from preset durations (1, 2, or 3 hours) or set a custom timer (in minutes) to match your needs.

- **Fun Visual Celebrations:**  
  Enjoy a pop-up celebration with confetti animations and a virtual reward when your timer ends.

- **Persistent Rewards:**  
  Earned rewards are saved using AsyncStorage, ensuring that your progress stays intact.

- **Inspirational Quotes:**  
  Every reward comes with a random motivational quote to keep you inspired.
